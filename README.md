## Description
Visual NLP is an interactive Streamlit application designed to provide a comprehensive visualization of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This user-friendly tool is ideal for both NLP beginners and experts who wish to explore and understand the intricacies of text preprocessing. Leveraging the powerful NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, Visual NLP enables users to apply and visualize several fundamental preprocessing techniques on textual data.

Features
- Tokenization: Split text into individual tokens or words. Visualize how sentences are broken down into smaller units.
- Stemming: Reduce words to their root form. See how different stemming algorithms process and transform words.
- Lemmatization: Convert words to their base or dictionary form. Compare the lemmatized output with the original text.
- Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging: Identify and label each word with its corresponding part of speech. Visualize the grammatical structure of sentences.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Detect and categorize named entities such as people, organizations, and locations within the text.
- Stop Words Removal: Eliminate common words that do not contribute much meaning. Observe the effect on the text when stop words are removed.
- Additional Preprocessing Tasks: Explore more advanced text preprocessing techniques supported by NLTK.
#### Benefits
- Interactive Visualization: Gain a deeper understanding of NLP preprocessing tasks through dynamic and interactive visualizations.
- Educational Tool: Perfect for students, educators, and professionals who want to learn or teach the basics of NLP.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy to use with a clean, intuitive design that simplifies the process of text preprocessing.
